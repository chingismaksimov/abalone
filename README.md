This project is about constructing a predictive model for the abalone dataset (available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone). There are 2 jupyter notebooks: descriptive_stats and predictive_models. The former deals with data preparation and description. The latter is all about building a regression model.

The original data is saved in "abalone.data" file. "clean_data" file contains the output from the first jupyter notebook and is used in the second jupyter notebook.
